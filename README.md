# 💫 About Me:

## Hi there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm Abdelrahman Zahra, a Full Stack Software Engineer with a background in Computing & Information Sciences and experience building scalable web applications, RESTful APIs, and microservices-based systems.

My work focuses on designing secure backend services, optimizing high-throughput APIs, and deploying cloud-native applications using AWS, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines. I’ve contributed to decomposing legacy systems into containerized microservices, implementing role-based access control (RBAC), and improving deployment efficiency through blue/green release strategies.
On the frontend, I work with modern JavaScript frameworks including React and Next.js, while building backend systems with FastAPI and Django. I’ve also worked with relational and NoSQL databases and integrated AI/ML capabilities into data-driven applications.

I’m particularly interested in building systems that are scalable, secure, and performance-focused - delivering measurable improvements in reliability, efficiency, and user experience in production environments.
Open to opportunities in full-stack, backend, and cloud-focused engineering roles.
